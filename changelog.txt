    # Should players be allowed to place upgradeable furnaces only in claimed regions?
    # This disallows placing upgradeable furnaces in wilderness. If a claim is being removed, all furnaces inside it will be removed as well and will drop to the ground
    # or be given to the owner of the furnace.

    # Remove furnaces of players that get untrusted from a region?
    # The furnaces will be removed and the furnace item will drop to the ground or be given to the player, if the furnace is in a loaded chunk.
    # If the furnace isn't in a loaded chunk, it will simply drop to the ground, the next time the chunk loads.
