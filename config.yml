general:
  # Default: English (en-US) - no download required.
  # This defines the default language. You can place multiple locales in the plugin's "Language" folder to display different locales depending on the player's locale.
  # You can access translations maintained by the community in our Discord: https://discord.gg/B4MAJVk
  # To access translations, other than en-US, execute /translations in the Discord server.
  # The translation name should match the official language code (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk8-jre8-suported-locales.html).
  # This option also affects the grouping and decimal separator for currency formatting.

  eco-format:
    # Recommended format for item economy and player experience: "# gold ingot(s)" or "# experience"
    normal: '$#,##0.00'
    # The short format will use the normal format if the value is lower than 1000.
    # This format is only used in cases where there is not much space, like on signs.
    # This will convert balances like the following:
    # 1000000000 = 1B whereas {value} = 1 and {unit} = B
    # 1000000 = 1M
    # 1000 = 1k
    short-unit: '${value}{unit}'

  # Date format
